**Hello Professor,
I tried to give my best for this weeks assignment, but due to time constraint and this weeks topic a bit complicated for me, I don't think so I got the Python coding part for this weeks assignment right. I did go through the reference link that you shared but still I could not understand the problem completely. Is there a better document, website that I could refer for doing the Fuzzy model in Python.**
