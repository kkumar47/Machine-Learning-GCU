This file explains provides the details about all the uploaded assignment for Topic 2 of course DSC 540 - O500- Machine Learning. The list of files for the Topic 1 assignement are as follows.

a) Part 1: 

* _DSC 540- Topic2-Assignment-Theory-APA.docx_: This file explains about the theoretical topic about the role of both Confusion Matrix and ROC curve in Machine Learning

b) Part 2: 

* _DSC-540-Topic2-Assignment-Final.IPYNB_ : This file has the python code to compute the KNN classification model for MNIST dataset. In order to run the code down load the train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz, train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz, t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz and t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz from the http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. Once these files are downloaded unzip these files (I unzipped the files using putty amnd moved it to the windows directory) and move it to the working directory of the Jupyter Notebook. If you are not sure of the working directory , open a python notebook and type in 'pwd' and this should give the current working directory. Once done we can run the code line by selecting all the cells (shift + left click) and hit run to execute the code.
* _DSC-540-Topic2-Assignment-Final.pdf_ : This file has the output for the above python notebook captured in a pdf file.
* _DSC 540- Topic2-Assignment-Practical-APA_: This document provides the technical review of the KNN classifier algorithm used in the above python notebook.
